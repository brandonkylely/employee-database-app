  ## Description

  This application runs in your local terminal to help you manage your employees, their roles, and their departments! You can view these tables and add to them by filling in the appropriate information when prompted. Assign or update managers as well simply by choosing the designated employee and the manager to assign them to.

  ## Installation

  Please run the schema.sql to create the employees_db database (Warning: running the schema if you already have an employees_db database will drop your previous database). Please run "npm i" to install the necessary dependencies.

  ## Usage

  In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the application and run "node index". From there, simply use your arrow keys to navigate to the action you wish to perform!
